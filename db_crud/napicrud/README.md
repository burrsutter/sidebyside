# multi-part-platform

Created by the Cloud App Generator

Now that the application has been generated it can be deployed in the currently active project on OpenShift by running:

```
$ ./gap deploy
```

Now the only thing that is left to do is push the project's code to OpenShift to be run. To push the sources and
have the project be built on OpenShift you can do the following:

```
$ ./gap push
```

But it's better if you go into each of the sub directories and read the READMEs specifically tailored for each runtime.
